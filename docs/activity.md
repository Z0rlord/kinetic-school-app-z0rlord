### Key Features Implemented
1. **Basic Application Structure** - Complete
2. **Development Environment Setup** - Complete
3. **Security Configuration** - Basic implementation complete
4. **Responsive UI Framework** - Bootstrap integration complete
5. **Database Connection Layer** - Complete with error handling
6. **Environment Configuration** - Template created

### Next Steps (Phase 2)
1. Database schema design and migration scripts
2. User authentication system implementation
3. Basic API endpoints for user management
4. Frontend authentication integration
5. Student profile CRUD operations

### Notes
- Following simplicity-first approach as specified in CLAUDE.md
- All placeholder components are functional and ready for implementation
- Database utility provides transaction support and error handling
- Security middleware configured for production readiness
- Project structure allows for easy scaling while maintaining simplicity

### Issues to Address
- Need to create database schema and migration scripts
- Authentication system needs implementation
- File upload functionality needs testing
- Need to add proper error boundaries in React components

### Git Repository Status
- ✅ **Initial commit pushed to GitHub** (commit: 4e5e55a)
- ✅ **25 files committed** with 2,797 insertions
- ✅ **Complete project structure** now available on GitHub
- ✅ **.gitignore configured** to exclude sensitive files and build artifacts

## 2025-01-08 - Database Schema Design & Setup

### Completed Tasks
- ✅ Created comprehensive MariaDB database schema with 12 tables
- ✅ Implemented database migration system with rollback support
- ✅ Created database seeder with sample data for development
- ✅ Added HashiCorp Vault integration for production secrets management
- ✅ Updated database utilities to support Vault configuration
- ✅ Created DigitalOcean deployment scripts and configuration
- ✅ Added PM2 ecosystem configuration for production
- ✅ Created Nginx reverse proxy configuration with security headers
- ✅ Updated package.json with database management scripts

### Database Schema Implemented
**Core Tables:**
- `users` - Authentication and user management (admin/teacher/student roles)
- `student_profiles` - Extended student information and profile completion tracking
- `classes` - Teacher-created classes with enrollment management
- `class_enrollments` - Many-to-many relationship between students and classes

**Goals & Skills Tables:**
- `goals` - Student goals with priorities, categories, and progress tracking
- `skills` - Skills inventory with proficiency levels and verification
- `interests` - Student interests categorized by type and importance level

**Survey System Tables:**
- `surveys` - Survey templates and metadata with status tracking
- `survey_questions` - Individual questions with multiple question types
- `survey_responses` - User responses to surveys with completion tracking
- `survey_answers` - Individual answers to questions with flexible data types
- `survey_assignments` - Assign surveys to classes or individual students

**File Storage Table:**
- `uploaded_files` - BLOB storage for resumes, photos, and attachments with metadata

### Key Features Implemented
1. **Migration System** - Version-controlled database changes with rollback support
2. **Seeding System** - Sample data for development and testing
3. **HashiCorp Vault Integration** - Production-ready secrets management
4. **DigitalOcean Deployment** - Complete server setup automation
5. **Security Configuration** - Rate limiting, CORS, security headers
6. **File Storage** - Database BLOB storage as specified in requirements
